            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">In the last 20 years, the Internet has grown from being nearly
                non-existent into the largest, most accessible database of information ever created. It has changed the
                way people communicate, shop, socialise, do business and think about knowledge and learning. Much more
                than just a new twist on distance learning, online schooling is changing the face of traditional
                classrooms and making education more accessible than ever before.
                Online education is a form of education where students use their home computers through the internet.
                For many nontraditional students, among them all those who want to continue working full time or raising
                families, online graduations and courses have become popular in the past decade. Often online graduation
                and course programmes, some of which are conducted using digital technologies, are provided via the
                online learning portal of the host university.

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">With the emergence and spread of COVID-19 in India, online education has
                trickled down to the most basic level — schools and colleges! When asked about their experience with
                online teaching, a student from a college in Bengaluru said, ​“The online option is a need in this
                pandemic situation. It has brought education to us without us going anywhere, and it is more flexible”.
                Probably, students are finding it a welcome change from strict schedules and long-distance commutes to
                attend classes. For some others, who find learning in large classes intimidating, this may be a less
                stressful option. Many teachers are making the best of this situation by exploring new methods of
                teaching and assessment.

            <hr>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">One of the most oft-used terms after the pandemic is the term “new
                normal.” The new normal in education is the increased use of online learning tools. The COVID-19
                pandemic has triggered new ways of learning. All around the world, educational institutions are looking
                toward online learning platforms to continue with the process of educating students. The new normal now
                is a transformed concept of education with online learning at the core of this transformation. Today,
                digital learning has emerged as a necessary resource for students and schools all over the world. For
                many educational institutes, this is an entirely new way of education that they have had to adopt.
                Online learning is now applicable not just to learn academics but it also extends to learning
                extracurricular activities for students as well. In recent months, the demand for online learning has
                risen significantly, and it will continue doing so in the future. </p>

                self- esteem of a woman. When she feels attractive and beautiful, it exudes her mood. Most women love to
                buy designer and stylish clothes. This is not because they are not satisfied enough, it is about the
                confidence that clothing can bring to them.On a larger scale, fashion is important because it represents
                our history and helps to tell the story of the world. ... Clothes help to keep people ready for whatever
                they may face in life but fashion keeps up with the current crazes and changes that we all face so that
                we're ready for whatever life throws our way.Throughout the ages fashion has been an important part of
                society and culture. ... Fashion is important in society because it has the potential to bring different
                people together to celebrate their own individuality. The best way to enjoy fashion is to wear what you
                love and be yourself!
